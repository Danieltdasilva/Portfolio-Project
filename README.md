# Portfolio-Project

Hello everyone,

I thought I'd start my programming journey with a simple idea: a blog.
It is something I had always dreamt of when I was growing up and I thought it'd be a good idea.
I am doing this blog as part of a portfolio project for Nucamp, my Full Stack bootcamp. I am planning to also add backend to it... I just don't know how yet.
Below are some pictures of how I imagined it to look:

Is it going to look EXACTLY like that? probably not. I will make changes as I go.
